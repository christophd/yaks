# Kamelets support

This sample shows the usage of Apache Camel K Kamelets. Users can create Kamelets and verify the ready state
in the current namespace. Once the Kamelet is ready the tests can create a Camel K integration that uses the Kamelet as source.

## Create Kamelets

The feature creates a new Kamelet in the current namespace and uses the Kamelet source in a
Camel K integration.

[kamelet.feature](kamelet.feature)
```shell script
$ yaks run examples/kamelets/kamelet.feature
```

## Create Kamelets using file resources

File resources are added to the test using the `yaks-config.yaml` file present in the test directory, which is automatically loaded by YAKS.

*yaks-config.yaml*
```yaml
config:
  runtime:
    resources:
    - timer-to-log.groovy 
    - timer-source.kamelet.yaml 
```


[kamelet-resource.feature](kamelet-resource.feature)
```shell script
$ yaks run examples/kamelets/kamelet-resource.feature
```             

The test is able to load the Kamelet using the external file resource. Also the Camel K integration code
is loaded from a file resource in this example.

You could also specify files to load in the command line

```shell script
$ yaks run examples/kamelets/kamelet-resource.feature \
            --resource timer-to-log.groovy \
            --resource timer-source.kamelet.yaml
```
