== Apache Camel K steps

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift).

If the subject under test is a Camel K integration, you can leverage the YAKS Camel K bindings
that provide useful steps for managing Camel K integrations.

.Working with Camel K integrations
[source,gherkin]
----
Given create Camel K integration helloworld.groovy
"""
from('timer:tick?period=1000')
  .setBody().constant('Hello world from Camel K!')
  .to('log:info')
"""
Given Camel K integration helloworld is running
Then Camel K integration helloworld should print Hello world from Camel K!
----

The YAKS framework provides the Camel K extension library by default. You can create a new Camel K integration and check the status of
the integration (e.g. running).

The following sections describe the available Camel K steps in detail.

[[camel-k-api-version]]
=== API version

The default Camel K API version used to create and manage resources is `v1`. You can overwrite this
version with a environment variable set on the YAKS configuration.

.Overwrite Camel K API version
[source,bash]
----
YAKS_CAMELK_API_VERSION=v1
----

This sets the Camel K API version for all operations.

[[camel-k-create]]
=== Create Camel K integrations

.@Given("^(?:create|new) Camel K integration {name}.{type}$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given create Camel K integration {name}.groovy
"""
<<Camel DSL>>
"""
----

Creates a new Camel K integration with specified route DSL. The integration is automatically started and can be referenced with its
`{name}` in other steps.

.@Given("^(?:create|new) Camel K integration {name}.{type} with configuration:$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given create Camel K integration {name}.groovy with configuration:
  | dependencies | mvn:org.foo:foo:1.0,mvn:org.bar:bar:0.9 |
  | traits       | quarkus.native=true,quarkus.enabled=true,route.enabled=true |
  | properties   | foo.key=value,bar.key=value |
  | source       | <<Camel DSL>> |
----

You can add optional configurations to the Camel K integration such as dependencies, traits and properties.

.Source
The route DSL as source for the Camel K integration.

.Dependencies
List of Maven coordinates that will be added to the integration runtime as a library.

.Traits
List of trait configuration that will be added to the integration spec. Each trait configuration value must be in the format `traitname.key=value`.

.Properties
List of property bindings added to the integration. Each value must be in the format `key=value`.

[[camel-k-load]]
=== Load Camel K integrations

.@Given("^load Camel K integration {name}.{type}$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given load Camel K integration {name}.groovy
----

Loads the file `{name}.groovy` as a Camel K integration.

[[camel-k-delete]]
=== Delete Camel K integrations

.@Given("^delete Camel K integration {name}$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given delete Camel K integration {name}
----

Deletes the Camel K integration with given `{name}`.

[[camel-k-integration-state]]
=== Verify integration state

A Camel K integration is run in a normal Kubernetes pod. The pod has a state and is in a phase (e.g. running, stopped).
You can verify the state with an expectation.

.@Given("^Camel K integration {name} is running/stopped$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Camel K integration {name} is running
----

Checks that the Camel K integration with given `{name}` is in state running and that the number of replicas is > 0. The step polls
the state of the integration for a given amount of attempts with a given delay between attempts. You can adjust the polling settings with:

.@Given Camel K resource polling configuration
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Camel K resource polling configuration
    | maxAttempts          | 10   |
    | delayBetweenAttempts | 1000 |
----

[[camel-k-watch-logs]]
=== Watch Camel K integration logs

.@Given("^Camel K integration {name} should print (.*)$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Camel K integration {name} should print {log-message}
----

Watches the log output of a Camel K integration and waits for given `{log-message}` to be present in the logs. The step polls the
logs for a given amount of time. You can adjust the polling configuration with:

.@Given Camel K resource polling configuration
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Camel K resource polling configuration
    | maxAttempts          | 10   |
    | delayBetweenAttempts | 1000 |
----

You can also wait for a log message to *not* be present in the output. Just use this step:

.@Given("^Camel K integration {name} should not print (.*)$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Camel K integration {name} should not print {log-message}
----

[[camel-k-resources]]
=== Manage Camel K resources

The Camel K steps are able to create resources such as integrations. By default these resources get removed automatically after the test scenario.

The auto removal of Camel K resources can be turned off with the following step.

.@Given("^Disable auto removal of Camel K resources$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Disable auto removal of Camel K resources
----

Usually this step is a `Background` step for all scenarios in a feature file. This way multiple scenarios can work on the very same Camel K resources and share
integrations.

There is also a separate step to explicitly enable the auto removal.

.@Given("^Enable auto removal of Camel K resources$")
[source,gherkin]
----
Given Enable auto removal of Camel K resources
----

By default, all Camel K resources are automatically removed after each scenario.
