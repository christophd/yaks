[[configuration]]
= Configuration

There are several runtime options that you can set in order to configure which tests to run for instance. Each test directory
can have its own `yaks-config.yaml` configuration file that holds the runtime options for this specific test suite.

[source,yaml]
----
config:
  runtime:
    cucumber:
      tags:
      - "not @ignored"
      glue:
      - "org.citrusframework.yaks"
      - "com.company.steps.custom"
----

The sample above uses different runtime options for Cucumber to specify a tag filter and some custom glue packages that
should be loaded. The given runtime options will be set as environment variables in the YAKS runtime pod.

You can also specify the Cucumber options that get passed to the Cucumber runtime.

[source,yaml]
----
config:
  runtime:
    cucumber:
      options: "--strict --monochrome --glue org.citrusframework.yaks"
----

Also we can make use of command line options when using the `yaks` binary.

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run hello-world.feature --tag @regression --glue org.citrusframework.yaks
----

[[configuration-dependencies]]
== Runtime dependencies

The YAKS testing framework provides a base runtime image that holds all required libraries and artifacts to execute tests. You may need to add
additional runtime dependencies though in order to extend the framework capabilities.

For instance when using a Camel route in your test you may need to add additional Camel components that are not part in the
basic YAKS runtime (e.g. camel-groovy). You can add the runtime dependency to the YAKS runtime image in multiple ways:

[[configuration-tags]]
=== Cucumber tags

You can simply add a tag to your BDD feature specification in order to declare a runtime dependency for your test.

[source,gherkin]
----
@require('org.apache.camel:camel-groovy:@camel.version@')
Feature: Camel route testing

  Background:
    Given Camel route hello.xml
    """
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:hello"/>
      <filter>
        <groovy>request.body.startsWith('Hello')</groovy>
        <to uri="log:org.citrusframework.yaks.camel?level=INFO"/>
      </filter>
      <split>
        <tokenize token=" "/>
        <to uri="seda:tokens"/>
      </split>
    </route>
    """

  Scenario: Hello route
    When send to route direct:hello body: Hello Camel!
    And receive from route seda:tokens body: Hello
    And receive from route seda:tokens body: Camel!
----

The given Camel route uses the groovy language support and this is not part in the basic YAKS runtime image. So we add
the tag `@require('org.apache.camel:camel-groovy:@camel.version@')`. This tag will load the Maven dependency at runtime
before the test is executed in the YAKS runtime image.

Note that you have to provide proper Maven artifact coordinates with proper `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version`. You can make
use of version properties for these versions available in the YAKS base image:

* citrus.version
* camel.version
* spring.version
* cucumber.version

[[configuration-properties]]
=== System property or environment setting

You can add dependencies also by specifying the dependencies as command line parameter when running the test via `yaks` CLI.

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --dependency org.apache.camel:camel-groovy:@camel.version@ camel-route.feature
----

This will add a environment setting in the YAKS runtime container and the dependency will be loaded automatically
at runtime.

[[configuration-properties-file]]
=== Property file

YAKS supports adding runtime dependency information to a property file called `yaks.properties`. The dependency is added through
Maven coordinates in the property file using a common property key prefix `yaks.dependency.`

[source,properties]
----
# include these dependencies
yaks.dependency.foo=org.foo:foo-artifact:1.0.0
yaks.dependency.bar=org.bar:bar-artifact:1.5.0
----

You can add the property file when running the test via `yaks` CLI like follows:

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --settings yaks.properties camel-route.feature
----

[[configuration-file]]
=== YAKS configuration file

When more dependencies are required to run a test you may consider to add a configuration file as `.yaml` or `.json`.

The configuration file is able to declare multiple dependencies:

[source,yaml]
----
dependencies:
  - groupId: org.foo
    artifactId: foo-artifact
    version: 1.0.0
  - groupId: org.bar
    artifactId: bar-artifact
    version: 1.5.0
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "groupId": "org.foo",
      "artifactId": "foo-artifact",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    {
      "groupId": "org.bar",
      "artifactId": "bar-artifact",
      "version": "1.5.0"
    }
  ]
}
----

You can add the configuration file when running the test via `yaks` CLI like follows:

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --settings yaks.settings.yaml camel-route.feature
----

[[configuration-repositories]]
== Maven repositories and pluginRepositories

When adding custom runtime dependencies those artifacts might not be available on the public central Maven repository.
Instead you may need to add a custom Maven repository that holds your artifacts.

You can do this with several configuration options:

[[configuration-repository-properties]]
=== System property or environment setting

You can add repositories also by specifying the repositories as command line parameter when running the test via `yaks` CLI.

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --maven-repository jboss-ea=https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/ my.feature
----

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --maven-plugin-repository jboss-ea=https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/ my.feature
----

This will add a environment setting in the YAKS runtime container and the repository will be added to the Maven runtime project model.

[[configuration-repository-file]]
=== Property file

YAKS supports adding Maven repository information to a property file called `yaks.properties`. The dependency is added through
Maven repository id and url in the property file using a common property key prefix `yaks.repository.`

[source,properties]
----
# Maven repositories
yaks.repository.central=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
yaks.repository.jboss-ea=https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/

# Maven plugin repositories
yaks.pluginRepository.central=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
yaks.pluginRepository.jboss-ea=https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/
----

You can add the property file when running the test via `yaks` CLI like follows:

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --settings yaks.properties my.feature
----

[[configuration-repository-config]]
=== YAKS configuration file

More complex repository configuration might require to add a configuration file as `.yaml` or `.json`.

The configuration file is able to declare multiple repositories:

[source,yaml]
----
repositories:
  - id: "central"
    name: "Maven Central"
    url: "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/"
    releases:
      enabled: "true"
      updatePolicy: "daily"
    snapshots:
      enabled: "false"
  - id: "jboss-ea"
    name: "JBoss Community Early Access Release Repository"
    url: "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/"
    layout: "default"

pluginRepositories:
  - id: "central"
    name: "Maven Central"
    url: "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/"
    releases:
      enabled: "true"
      updatePolicy: "daily"
    snapshots:
      enabled: "false"
  - id: "jboss-ea"
    name: "JBoss Community Early Access Release Repository"
    url: "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/"
    layout: "default"
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "repositories": [
      {
        "id": "central",
        "name": "Maven Central",
        "url": "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/",
        "releases": {
          "enabled": "true",
          "updatePolicy": "daily"
        },
        "snapshots": {
          "enabled": "false"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "jboss-ea",
        "name": "JBoss Community Early Access Release Repository",
        "url": "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/",
        "layout": "default"
      }
    ],
    "pluginRepositories": [
      {
        "id": "central",
        "name": "Maven Central",
        "url": "https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/",
        "releases": {
          "enabled": "true",
          "updatePolicy": "daily"
        },
        "snapshots": {
          "enabled": "false"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "jboss-ea",
        "name": "JBoss Community Early Access Release Repository",
        "url": "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/ea/",
        "layout": "default"
      }
    ]
}
----

You can add the configuration file when running the test via `yaks` CLI like follows:

[source,shell script]
----
yaks run --settings yaks.settings.yaml my.feature
----

[[configuration-secrets]]
== Using secrets

Tests usually need to use credentials and connection URLs in order to connect to infrastructure components and services.
This might be sensitive data that should not go into the test configuration directly as hardcoded value. You should rather load the
credentials from a secret volume source.

To use the implicit configuration via secrets, we first need to create a configuration file holding the properties of a named configuration.

.mysecret.properties
[source,properties]
----
# Only configuration related to the "mysecret" named config
database.url=jdbc:postgresql://syndesis-db:5432/sampledb
database.user=admin
database.password=special
----

We can create a secret from that file and label it so that it will be picked up automatically by the YAKS operator:

[source,shell script]
----
# Create the secret from the property file
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=mysecret.properties
----

Once the secret is created you can bind it to a test via labels on the secret.
Given the test named `my-test.feature` you can bind the secret to the test by adding a label as follows:

.Bind secret to a test via labels
[source,shell script]
----
# Bind secret to the "my-test" test case
kubectl label secret my-secret yaks.citrusframework.org/test=my-test
----

When running a test the YAKS operator searches for all secrets labelled with the test name to automatically mount the secret to the test pod container.
All secret volumes get mounted to the test pod in `/etc/yaks/secrets` folder.
You can access this folder in the test in order to load the secrets and their content.

Instead of using the label based binding you can also specify a list of secret names on the test runtime config.
Each secret gets mounted to the test pod container.
With that in place you just need to set the secret name in your `yaks-config.yaml` for that test.

.yaks-config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
config:
  runtime:
    secrets:
      - my-secret
----

This assumes that there is a secret named `my-secret` available in the test namespace.
You can now write a test and load the content of the secret (e.g. files).
Also, property files in the secret get automatically loaded as test variables,
so you can reference the secret properties with the normal test variable syntax:

.my-test.feature
